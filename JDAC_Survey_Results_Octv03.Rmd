### <span style="color:#3f366d">Key Insights</span>
- The majority of respondents are fulfilled by their work and are satisfied with their DD team and JDAC as a whole.  Although the majority of participants felt that their workload was ‘just right’, eleven respondents (25%) felt their workload was ‘a bit heavy’.
-   Thirty-four respondents (39%) expressed that their wellbeing at work or home was ‘in a really good place’.  However, ten participants felt slightly less optimistic about their wellbeing - three (7%) reported there were areas at work that could be improved, while seven (16%) were concerned that their wellbeing may be negatively impacted if their experience at work worsened/ remained unchanged.
- Most teams across JDAC felt their views as well as contributions to their teams were respected and recognised.  Many participants also expressed feeling comfortable enough within JDAC to express their opinions.
- Although the majority of respondents expressed that diverse perspectives were often incorporated into recruitment (49%, 21) and collaborative working (48%, 21), 43% (17) of participants disclosed that they felt the views of minoritised employees were less involved in other areas or JDAC as a whole.
- Most respondents found Slido to be the most appropriate method of expressing ideas and all-staff meetings the least favourite mode of expressing opinions. This highlights the importance of potentially exploring alternative staff engagement activities across JDAC to continue to build positive environments or forums which minoritised communities feel are less exclusive.




### <span style="color:#3f366d">Monthly Questions</span>

#### <span style="color:#3f366d">Wellbeing at Work and in Life</span>

Of the 80 people approached, 44 participated (response rate = 55%) (Fig. 1).  

<br> <span style ="color:#000000; font-weight: 700">Fig. 1. Participant Demographics (by Team and Grade)</span> <br>
```{r, image_grobs3, fig.show="hold", out.width="50%", fig.align="default"}

knitr::include_graphics("Demo_1.png", error = FALSE)
knitr::include_graphics("Demo_2.png", error = FALSE)

#<span style ="color:#000000; font-size: 120%; font-weight: 545">Fig. 1 Wellbeing at Work</span>

```

The majority of respondents (77%, 34) expressed they were either 'in a really good place' (39%, 17) or 'in an ok place, but there are things I'd like to improve' whilst at work respectively (39%, 17) (Fig. 2).

<br> <span style ="color:#000000; font-weight: 700">Fig. 2 Wellbeing at Work and in Life</span> <br>
```{r, image_grobs, fig.show="hold", out.width="50%", fig.align="default"}

knitr::include_graphics("WB_1a.png", error = FALSE)
knitr::include_graphics("WB_2a.png", error = FALSE)

```

<br> Similarly, most participants (86%, 38) responded that in their personal life, they were either 'in a really good place' (39%, 17) or 'in an ok place, but there things I'd like to improve' (48%, 21) respectively.  Relatively low numbers of respondents across JDAC experienced lower mood at work (7%, 3) or in their personal lives (2%, 1).

```{r, echo=FALSE}



```
                                                                                              

#### <span style="color:#3f366d">Workload and Work Fulfillment</span>

The majority of respondents (59%, 26) felt that their workload was 'just right' (Fig. 3). However, a considerable proportion of respondents (25%, 11) found that their workload was 'a bit heavy' (Fig. 3).

<br> <span style ="color:#000000; font-weight: 700">Fig. 3 Workload Feelings</span> <br>
```{r, out.width = "500px"}

knitr::include_graphics("WK_1a.png", error = FALSE)

#<span style ="color:#000000; font-size: 120%; font-weight: 545">Fig. 3 Workload Feelings</span>


```
<br> On a scale of 1 to 5, where 1 indicated 'not at all' and 5 represented 'very well', a median score of 4 was reported for work fulfillment.  Most respondents (28) expressed they believed that they their job complemented their interests and skills (Fig. 4).

<br> <span style ="color:#000000; font-weight: 700">Fig. 4 Work Fulfillment</span> <br>
```{r, out.width = "500px"}

knitr::include_graphics("WK_2a.png", error = FALSE)

#<span style ="color:#000000; font-size: 120%; font-weight: 545">Fig. 4 Work Fulfillment</span>


```



#### <span style="color:#3f366d">Team Effectiveness</span>

The majority of respondents (41%, 18) expressed things were going 'really well' in their DD team, 'quite well' in JDAC (36%, 16) and 'ok' in EDS as a whole (59%, 26) (Fig. 5).

<br> <span style ="color:#000000; font-weight: 700">Fig. 5 Team Effectiveness</span> <br>
```{r, image_grobs4, fig.show="hold", out.width="50%", fig.align="default"}

knitr::include_graphics("S_1a.png", error = FALSE)
knitr::include_graphics("S_2a.png", error = FALSE)


#<span style ="color:#000000; font-size: 120%; font-weight: 545">Fig. 4 Work Fulfillment</span>


```

<br> However, themes identified from the survey highlight some concern regarding JDAC and it's place within EDS, the hierarchical nature of JDAC in comparison to the more flatter structure of SitCen  as well as a sense of a common culture across teams to encourage more connection across JDAC (e.g., between data science and thematic teams as well as between JDAC and SitCen). Some unease regarding uncertainty regarding prime ministerial change and potential departmental impacts suggests more frequent stand-ups led by the SLT that address potential restructure and foresight workshops that highlight the significance of change may help lessen staff anxieties.  Finally, some participants expressed interest in having more time dedicated to the results of staff surveys, resourcing and project decisions in team meetings.

#### <span style="color:#3f366d">Development and Training</span>

```{r, echo=FALSE}

```

The median response of participants reporting they had clearly defined goals was 3 of 5.
```{r, echo=FALSE}

```
Although ten respondents across JDAC were very confident of their goals and objectives, three participants in JDAC felt unclear about them (Fig. 6).  



<br> <span style ="color:#000000; font-weight: 700">Fig. 6 Established Goals</span> <br>
```{r, out.width = "500px"}

knitr::include_graphics("TD_1a.png", error = FALSE)

#<span style ="color:#000000; font-size: 120%; font-weight: 545">Fig. 5 Established Goals</span>


```
<br> Similarly, although most participants across JDAC felt they had either 'some, but not enough' (44%, 10) or 'very little' (35%, 8) core training and development, some participants (4, 17%) expressed they had undertaken the 'right amount' of it (Fig. 7).








<br> <span style ="color:#000000; font-weight: 700">Fig. 7 Core and Wider Training and Development</span> <br>
```{r, image_grobs2, fig.show="hold", out.width="50%", fig.align="default"}

knitr::include_graphics("TD_2a.png", error = FALSE)
knitr::include_graphics("TD_3a.png", error = FALSE)
```
<br> Furthermore, most respondents across JDAC also expressed feeling they had undertaken either 'very little' (35%, 8) or 'some, but not enough' (44%, 10) wider training and development (Fig. 7).  A common theme expressed amongst respondents highlighted there was some uncertainty regarding the prioritisation of learning and development in JDAC:

*"How do [the SLT] prioritise learning?"*


### <span style="color:#3f366d">Wildcard Questions</span>

<br> On a scale of 1 to 5, where 1 represented 'Never' and 5 represented 'Always', most participants across JDAC felt comfortable expressing their opinions in JDAC - the median score of respondents for feeling heard was 4 (Fig. 8).<br>

<br> <span style ="color:#000000; font-weight: 700">Fig. 8 I Feel Heard: Comfortability Expressing Opinions</span> <br>
```{r, out.width = "500px"}

knitr::include_graphics("TD_6a.png", error = FALSE)

#<span style ="color:#000000; font-size: 120%; font-weight: 545">Fig. 7 Mid-Year Review Preparedness</span>


```
<br> Similarly, most respondents across JDAC felt that their opinions were taken into consideration - the median score of respondents for feeling respected was 4 (Fig 9).

<br> <span style ="color:#000000; font-weight: 700">Fig. 9 I Feel Respected: My Opinions are Considered</span> <br>
```{r, out.width = "500px"}

knitr::include_graphics("TD_5a.png", error = FALSE)

#<span style ="color:#000000; font-size: 120%; font-weight: 545">Fig. 7 Mid-Year Review Preparedness</span>


```

Furthermore, many participants felt their contributions to the team were recognised and reported receiving regular feedback on their achievements - the median score of respondents for feeling valued and receiving regular feedback was 4 respectively.

Additionally, the majority of respondents expressed that diverse perspectives were often incorporated into: 

- Data Choice (41%, 19)
- Collaboration (48%, 21)
- Recruitment (49%, 21)
- Change (41%, 18). 

Outside of the listed options featured in the survey, although 43% (17) of participants reported that diverse opinions and perspectives were often involved in other areas/ JDAC as a whole, 43% (17) of respondents disclosed that they felt minoritised groups were less involved in these areas.

Interestingly, respondents highlighted that they found Slido to be the most appropriate method of expressing ideas - the median score was 4 (4-5).  All-staff meetings were the least favourite way of expressing opinions - the median score was 3 (2-4). 
<br> Reluctance to share views in all-staff meetings may suggest that there are barriers to speaking up and that staff may feel unsafe to challenge the culture of their workplace.  These results may also indicate that staff require more explicit information or anonymity expressing their ideas about the behaviours they expect in their workspaces, the desire to eliminate 'grey' areas and a better experience when sharing their views. 

These results also suggests that the development of 360-degree feedback tools and independent processes, such as 'champions', that are separate from HR, to confidently engage with active staff networks and carefully navigate a balance of mutual support and action may help JDAC continue to build a less exclusive culture.  Best practice and lessons learnt evaluations comparing 'best' performing teams against ones that are more resistant to change may highlight characteristics that help minoritised groups feel a greater sense of fairness and belonging.


Although this is a self-selecting sample which may consist of low numbers of participants from minoritised communities, themes identified may provide a good idea of how staff currently feel across JDAC.

## <span style="color:#3f366d">Methodology</span>

Each item in the survey was reviewed within the JDAC Pulse Survey Strand as well as the Diversity and Inclusion Group so the relevance and appropriateness could be discussed.  A pilot test  conducted during a Senior Management Team meeting asked volunteers to verbally evaluate items that were not understood.  No difficulties were encountered.  Minor changes were made to the questions in the final version following the pilot.

The survey consisted of 19 questions and four sections (please refer to  Table 1).
